# AutoLearn - Automated Feature Generation and Selection (ICDM 2017)

This repository contains source code for the research work described in:

[AutoLearn — Automated Feature Generation and Selection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8215494)


## Dependencies

* **[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)** for modelling
* **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** for data manipulation
* **[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)** for performing mathematical operations
* **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)** for plotting 2D graphs

## How to Run
```
python main.py
```


## Note:
-- The current version of the code is not optimized. I will updated the optimized version in coming weeks.

-- The hyperparameters values of the threshold are hard coded. Use hyperparameter optimization for best results.

-- All dataset files should follow the same template as that of sonar.csv (label column at the last)
